.\" SYNOPSIS
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl fqv
.Op Fl d Ar database-path
.Op Fl t Ar theme-directory
.\" DESCRIPTION
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a simple CGI or FastCGI program to host code snippets over a web
interface. It will show most recent public pastes and let users to create new
one from a web form.
.Pp
It supports:
.Bl -bullet -compat
.It
Listing of recent pastes,
.It
Submission of new pastes,
.It
Searching existing pastes,
.It
Language highlighting (depending on the theme),
.It
Private pastes (not listed).
.El
.Pp
To store pastes,
.Nm
uses a SQLite database that must be writable by the CGI/FastCGI owner. See usage
below.
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
Starts as FastCGI mode,
.Nm
will wait forever for new requests.
.It Fl d Ar database-path
Specify an alternate path for the database.
.It Fl t Ar theme-directory
Specify an alternate directory for the theme.
.It Fl q
Do not log through syslog at all.
.It Fl v
Increase verbosity level.
.El
.\" USAGE
.Sh USAGE
The
.Nm
utility does not use configuration file as it does not need many adjustments,
instead every parameter could be passed by environment variables or options.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
will try to use
.Pa @VARDIR@/paster/paster.db
database.
.\" LOGS
.Sh LOGS
The
.Nm
utility will log information through syslog unless verbosity is disabled.
Except at startup where the tool can write to stderr some information if it
can't continue processing, the tool will never write anything to stdout and
use syslog only.
.Pp
The available verbosity level is defined in the following order:
.Bd -literal -offset Ds
none < warnings (default) < info < debug
.Ed
.Pp
Use
.Fl q
or
.Va PASTERD_VERBOSITY=0
if you want to disable syslog completely.
.\" USING WITH FASTCGI
.Sh USING WITH FASTCGI
The recommended way to use
.Nm
is to deploy using FastCGI. You can use the
.Xr kfcgi 8
helper to spawn the process for you.
.Pp
Example:
.Bd -literal -offset Ds
kfcgi -p /var/www/paster -- pasterd -f -d paster.db -t siimple
.Ed
.Pp
Note: kfcgi chroot to the directory given, you must either statically link
pasterd at build time or deploy all required libraries. Also, themes directory
will need to be available in the chroot directory. In the above example, this
will effectively create a database
.Pa /var/www/paster/paster.db
and use the theme
.Pa /var/www/paster/siimple .
.Pp
Then, simply copy the desired theme into the directory.
.Bd -literal -offset Ds
cp -R @SHAREDIR@/paster/themes/siimple /var/www/paster
.Ed
.Pp
As an
.Em insecure
alternative, you can chroot to
.Pa /
to avoid static-linking and copying themes, using:
.Bd -literal -offset Ds
kfcgi -p / -- pasterd -f \e
	-d /var/www/paster/paster.db \e
	-t @SHAREDIR@/paster/themes/siimple
.Ed
.Pp
Both kfcgi invocations will create
.Pa /var/www/run/http.sock
with current user and group. Configure the web server to talk to that socket
and make sure it has appropriate file permissions otherwise see
.Fl u
option in
.Nm kfcgi .
See also the
.Xr kfcgi 8
manual for more information.
.Pp
Next, configure the web server.
.Pp
Warning: at this moment,
.Nm
requires its own virtual host and can
.Em not
use a url.
.\" Server: nginx
.Ss Server: nginx
The nginx web server requires several parameters to run
.Nm .
.Bd -literal
server {
	server_name mypaste.fr;
	listen 80;

	location / {
		fastcgi_param QUERY_STRING      query_string;
		fastcgi_param REQUEST_METHOD    $request_method;
		fastcgi_param CONTENT_TYPE      $content_type;
		fastcgi_param CONTENT_LENGTH    $content_length;
		fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME   $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
		fastcgi_param SCRIPT_NAME       $fastcgi_script_name;
		fastcgi_param PATH_INFO         $document_uri;
		fastcgi_param PATH_TRANSLATED   $document_root$fastcgi_path_info;
		fastcgi_param REQUEST_URI       $request_uri;
